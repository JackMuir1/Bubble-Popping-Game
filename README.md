# Bubble-Popping-Game
A simple video game where you must pop the bubbles before they reach the top of the screen


Made using the unity 2D engine. Bubbles appear at the bottom of the screen, and users must pop them before they reach the top. As time increases, the bubbles move faster and begin to appear more frequently. Includes original music, sound effects, sprites, animations, and menus.

As of 12/13/21 - Only the C# files are available, working on the full unity project shortly.
